# CycleGAN Image to Image Translation

I created this project while participating in the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree<br/>
The goal of the project was to use a CycleGAN CNN model to transfer images from one domain to another<br/>
When domains represent a style/texture - the idea is to separate the image content from its style.<br/>
In this project I transferred [Yosemtie national park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosemite_National_Park) images from "winter" to "summer" and vice versa.<br/>
Project is based on the ["Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf) article.<br/>
Code is written in python with PyTorch library on a Jupyter Notebook platform.
